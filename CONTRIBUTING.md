## Code quality

Dug does not currently implement any requirement for a specific code style. 
That policy may change. 

## VC Strategy

Dug devs prefer to use [gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 
The TL;DR is:

    1. New work should be on a separate branch off of develop
        a. except hotfixes, which branch off master
    2. Work should never be committed directly to master or develop
    3. The develop branch should always be into a ready-to-release state
        a. no broken develop builds

## Writing good commit messages
